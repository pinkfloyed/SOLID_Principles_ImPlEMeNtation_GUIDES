# SOLID Principles Demo – Java Project

This Repository demonstrates examples of all 5 SOLID principles in object-oriented design (ODD) using Java. Each principle has two implementations:
- ❌ `Bad_Code/` — Violates the principle
- ✅ `Good_Code/` — Follows best practices

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `Bad_Code/` – Contains code that breaks one or more SOLID principles.
- `Good_Code/` – Contains correct implementation using SOLID.
- `Main.java` – Entry point to run demos.
- `README.md` – You're reading it!

## 🔍 Principles Covered

1. **S** – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O** – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I** – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## 🚀 How to Run this Project

Compile and run `Main.java` to see examples in action:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
